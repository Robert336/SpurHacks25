1. Task Cards (Core Interaction)
Think of these as cozy “bounty” posters or little illustrated notes on a community board.

Visual Style:

Rounded corners (border-radius: 1rem)

Light pastel backgrounds (#FFF4E6 or #E9D8C5)

Small hand-drawn-style icons (broom, laundry, plant, etc.)

Optional: “Stamps” or badges for completed tasks

Info Structure:

🎯 Task Title (e.g. “Vacuum Living Room”)

💰 Bounty Value (e.g. “$3 from the Pool”)

🧍 Assigned / Unclaimed

✅ “Claim” or “Mark Done” button with a micro animation (like a stamp, coin drop, or sparkles)

2. Money Pool Dashboard
This is the shared “treasury” of the house — the heart of the gamification.

Style:

Framed like a cozy treasure chest or a community pot graphic

Monthly bar (progress bar filling up as tasks are claimed)

Icons for who has contributed this month (maybe cute coin avatars)

Breakdown of recent payouts (“Alex earned $4.50 for dishes”)

3. Wallet / Earnings
Your personal record — make it feel rewarding and motivating.

Style:

Soft gradient background (lavender or forest green)

Coin stack or flower pouch icon

Daily/Weekly “Task Log” (tiny illustrated timeline of chores)

“Goal” saving area (like a piggy bank)

4. Household / Group View
Treat this like a cozy “village square” or map with each member represented.

Ideas:

Avatars are animal stickers or fantasy-house tiles (like your moodboard)

You can click on someone’s house/avatar to see their tasks

Light animations: lights turn on when someone’s online, or a bird lands on their icon if they completed something

5. Buttons & UI Elements
These should feel tactile, soft, and fun to press.

Style:

Pill-shaped buttons (not too boxy)

Colors: use yellows (#FFD972), greens (#74A27E), purples (#9A7FF5)

Hover effects: soft shadow, slight “lift” effect

Icons: Tiny doodles (leaf, brush, sparkle, paw print)
